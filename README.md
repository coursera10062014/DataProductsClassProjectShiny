# Global Temperature Trends

This project is a shiny application intended as a solution to a class project in the 
Coursera Data Products class.

The appliation presents a plot of the annual mean temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere since 1880.
Those temperatures are compared to a 1951-1980 baseline period, and each year is presented as an
offset from the mean of that period, measured in hundredths of a degree celcius.

You can find a running version of this application [here](https://coursera10062014b.shinyapps.io/DataProductsClassProjectShiny/)
